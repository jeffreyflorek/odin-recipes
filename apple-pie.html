        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This apple pie recipe is the best I've ever made. The secret is I
            used Granny Smith apples. The apples are not as sweet as some, which
            makes them good for pie. Granny Smiths are also really tart and help
            maintain the consistency of the filling.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Crust</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 box of pie crusts</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups thinly sliced, peeled apples (6 medium)</li>
            <li>3/4 cups sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 425Â°F. Place 1 pie crust in ungreased 9-inch glass
                pie plate. Press firmly against side and bottom.</li>
            <li>In large bowl, gently mix filling ingredients; spoon into
                crust-lined pie plate. Top with second crust. Wrap excess top
                crust under bottom crust edge, pressing edges together to seal;
                flute. Cut slits or shapes in several places in top crust.</li>
            <li>Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until apples are tender and crust is
                golden brown. Cover edge of crust with 2- to 3-inch wide strips
                of foil after first 15 to 20 minutes of baking to prevent
                excessive browning. Cool on cooling rack at least 2 hours before
                serving.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe for kettle corn is a staple around Labor Day and
            Halloween! The popcorn has to be popped, and we usually do it on the
            weekend, but you can do it any day that you have enough free time.
            And because it's a favorite of mine, I'm sharing it here. It's
            really easy to make, and it's so delicious!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unpopped popcorn kernels</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Once hot, stir in the sugar and popcorn.</li>
            <li>Cover, and shake the pot constantly to keep the sugar from
                burning.</li>
            <li>Once the popping has slowed to once every 2 to 3 seconds, remove
                the pot from the heat and continue to shake for a few minutes
                until the popping has stopped.</li>
            <li>Pour into a large bowl, and allow to cool, stirring
                occasionally to break up large clumps.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
